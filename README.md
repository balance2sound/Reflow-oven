# DIY-reflow-oven (WORK IN PROGRESS)
## Reflow oven for soldering SMD and BGA's
### Buy list
- Oven. We've bought ours for 30 euros. Link: [https://www.amazon.es/Orbegozo-HO-980-temporizador-temperatura/dp/B08HKLRBBD](url) (if it have a fan the performance could be better)
- AC SSR's x2 with heatsink
- Arduino Mega or Due x1 **Note:** If using Arduino Due don't exceed I/O pins voltage: 3.3V! We've used a "Arduino Mega Pro Embed" to use it in the PCB.
- Screen HX8357 or ILI4986 480X320 TFT x1 **Note:** We use the Boodmer's HX8357/ILI4986 graphic library. GUI designers like GuiSlice does not support this screen from native.
- Heat resistant Mains cable.
- Rotary encoder with built-in button x1.
- Switch x1 .
- Max6675 Thermopar controller x 3 (1 for top, 1 for botton and 1 for the pcb).
- Thermopar type K x3.
- Usb or SD card module to save records (Optional).
- 1 85x85 fan (pull air) and other smaller fans to pull air in to the enclosure.
- Heat insulator (like ceramic fiber).
# Tutorial 
- Dissasemble the oven, saving the timer and the thermostat. We could use these parts in a future or as a replacement for others oven.
- Take measurements of the oven. Find the place where the components could be cool (control board, SSR's and the power supply), even if we use fans to keep them to acceptable temperatures**>85ÂºC** may damage the components 
-I selected enclosure of the timer and the thermostat. The pcb was designed to fit inside with some corrections of the enclosure (It slides in a slot made by a soldering iron in the threads.) We've made a window for the screen and glued with epoxy. (If silicon glue is used, must be high temperature resistant). I cut with a knive some reinforcements of the enclosure to fit the pcb.
